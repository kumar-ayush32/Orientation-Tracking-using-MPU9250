# Orientation-Tracking-using-MPU9250
## Objective
The objective of the project is to Track the real-time orientation of MPU and plot it in Matplotlib and transmit data it to a particular server using ESP32's inbuilt WiFi.
## Methodology
The MPU9250 is a versatile 9-axis MotionTracking device, combining a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, and 3-axis magnetometer in a single package. This allows it to measure orientation, motion, and magnetic fields, making it a powerful sensor for robotics, IoT, and navigation applications.

In this project, I:

1. Connected the MPU9250 to an ESP32 microcontroller.

2. Uploaded Arduino code to interface with the sensor.

3. Wrote a Python code to process the sensor data and plot its orientation in real time.

### Software tools
#### Arduino IDE: Used for writing, compiling, and uploading code to the ESP32.

#### Python Environment: Python code processes the data sent by the ESP32.

#### Key libraries: 

  1. Serial: Facilitates serial communication between ESP32 and the Python script.

  2. NumPy: Handles numerical operations, such as parsing sensor data.

  3. Matplotlib: Visualizes orientation data in a 3D plot.

#### Real-Time Plotting:

Matplotlibâ€™s 3D plotting capabilities help visualize real-time orientation. Quiver plots dynamically display the acceleration vector.

Select the correct board (Tools > Board > ESP32 Dev Module) and port (Tools > Port > COMx)

Open the Serial Monitor (Tools > Serial Monitor) and set the baud rate to 115200. You should see accelerometer and gyroscope data being printed.

## How to run the code
Download the arudino ide and run the files.

For simulation:
```bash
pip install serial matplotlib numpy
```
Then you are good to go
